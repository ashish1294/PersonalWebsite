                <h4>Programming Achievements</h4>
            </div>
            Competitive programming was once my primary hobby. I was very active on all the online judges.
            However, due to other commitments the time I spend now doing competitive programming has reduced
            considerably. I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms from competitive programming.
            It also provided me with a platform to prove my coding abilities. <br/> <br/>
            <ul>
              <li><b>CodeChef SWAG</b> : I was ranked within top-10 in India multiple times for which I was awarded with CodeChef SWAG</li> <br>
